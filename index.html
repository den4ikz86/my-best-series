    <br>
    <div class="mid">
        <p> <strong> La casa de pape</strong>, "The House of Paper" is a Spanish heist crime
            drama television series created by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%81lex_Pina"
                target="_blank">Álex
                Pina</a>. The series traces two long-prepared heists led by the Professor
            , one on the Royal Mint of Spain, and one on the Bank of Spain, told from the perspective of one
            of the robbers, Tokyo. The narrative is told in a real-time-like fashion and relies on
            flashbacks, time-jumps, hidden character motivations, and an unreliable narrator for complexity.
            <br>
            The series was initially intended as a limited series to be told in two parts. It had its original run of 15
            episodes on Spanish network Antena 3 from 2 May 2017 through 23 November 2017. <a
                href="https://www.netflix.com/il-en/" target="_blanket">Netflix</a> acquired global streaming
            rights in late 2017. It re-cut the series into 22 shorter episodes and released them worldwide, beginning
            with
            the first part on 20 December 2017, followed by the second part on 6 April 2018. In April 2018, Netflix
            renewed
            the series with a significantly increased budget for 16 new episodes total. Part 3, with eight episodes, was
            released on 19 July 2019. Part 4, also with eight episodes, was released on 3 April 2020. A documentary
            involving the producers and the cast premiered on Netflix the same day, titled Money Heist: The Phenomenon
            . In July 2020, Netflix renewed the show for a fifth and final part,
            which was released in two five-episode volumes on 3 September and 3 December 2021, respectively. Similar to
            Money Heist: The Phenomenon, a two-part documentary involving the producers and cast premiered on Netflix
            the
            same day, titled Money Heist: From Tokyo to Berlin. The series was filmed in Madrid, Spain. Significant
            portions
            were also filmed in Panama, Thailand, Italy (Florence), Denmark and in Portugal.
            <br>
            The series received several awards including the International Emmy Award for Best Drama Series at the 46th
            International Emmy Awards, as well as critical acclaim for its sophisticated plot, interpersonal dramas,
            direction, and for trying to innovate Spanish television. The Italian anti-fascist song "Bella ciao", which
            plays multiple times throughout the series, became a summer hit across Europe in 2018. By 2018, the series
            was
            the most-watched non-English-language series and one of the most-watched series overall on Netflix, having
            particular resonance with viewers from Mediterranean Europe and the Latin American regions.
